This project demonstrates ETL and data visualization techniques. 

I pulled data from the U.S Energy Information Administration API, formatted it, and loaded it into an AWS RDS MYSQL instance. 

I built a dashboard using Plotly Dash. This dashboard connects to the AWS database to allow for interactive visualizations. 

The Dash app is live here - https://energy-dash-app.herokuapp.com/
